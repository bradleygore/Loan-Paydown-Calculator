Loan-Paydown-Calculator
=======================

My first iteration of this loan paydown calculation app

I was still fairly new to javascript and very new to knockout.js, so the code isn't exactly great.  However, I did get it working fairly well and learned a ton.  Also learned to use a good bit of the flot.js library in order to incorporate some data vizualization.  I also build all of my own CSS except for the jQuery UI CSS. I didn't know about twitter bootstrap, etc... at that time, else I would've used that or HTML5 Boilerplate. I made a decent attempt at responsive design, though.
